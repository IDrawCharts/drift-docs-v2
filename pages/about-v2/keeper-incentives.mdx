# Keeper Incentives

Keepers **keep** the Drift network healthy.

## Keeper Rewards

For matching orders, Keepers receive a portion of the taker fee.

For cancelling orders (that can be cancelled see [**Advanced Orders FAQ**](/trading/advanced-orders-faq)), Keepers will receive the `cancel_order_fee` on the state.

Currently, the USDC reward function for keepers (_f_keeper_) is designed as:

![](https://archbee.imgix.net/ps_9Ff-LBbQB7IaXI3f3F/7X0tYmUqT218-A0gfXSz-_image.png)

where:
_t_order_ is seconds since the order was placed
_f_user_ is the taker fee paid by the user who placed the order

This reward is subject to evolve to incentivise CLOB-like execution ordering. See [**source code**](https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v1/blob/c748c64fcfa6d7fd5aba72f7021218dd6aaa02f0/programs/clearing_house/src/math/fees.rs#L257) for the on-chain calculation.

A Keeper reward multiplier (for taker price improvement) is applied to the keeper's minimum time-based reward component in the function above. Any percent improvement versus the baseline `oracle +/- 10bps`, increases this multiplier.

### Future Work

30d fill volume for keepers is tracked on-chain via `UserStats`, allowing for logic to reward consistent keepers with a larger multiplier on rewards.
