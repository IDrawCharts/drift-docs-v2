12. RISKS

12.1. By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Site in any way, you represent and warrant that you understand and agree to the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks (including, without limitation, sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” and advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may materially affect the Services); Digital Assets, including the usage and intricacies of native Digital Assets, like Solana (SOL); smart contract-based tokens, such as those that follow the Solana Token Standard; and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. Drift does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, including the Solana blockchains, is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it.

12.2. The Services and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take certain actions or provide information, which may not be in your best interest or could impede or limit the ability of Drift to continue to make available its proprietary software and, thus, could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services.

12.3. You understand that the smart contract and Solana blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Solana blockchain is variable and may increase or decrease at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Solana blockchain, which may result in losses, price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services.

12.4. Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Services, the Site and other information available when using the Services may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site or as part of the Services are your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Site or otherwise when using the Services. This means however, prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on other platforms providing similar services.

12.5.  Any use or interaction with the Services requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science to appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.

12.6. Use of the Services, including, without limitation, for trading Digital Assets, staking, borrowing or supplying Digital Assets, trading on margin, and entering into derivatives and swaps contracts, may carry financial risk.

Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible and final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets, especially when trading on margin, can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets, including any margin. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Services for performing Digital Asset transactions, including entering into margin position, borrow or lend, derivative or swap contracts.

12.7. You hereby assume and agree that Drift will have no responsibility or liability for the risks set forth in this Section 12 or otherwise as set out on the Site. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Drift, its affiliates, and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, suppliers, and contractors related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 12 or otherwise as set out on the Site.

16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS

16.1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER DRIFT NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT DRIFT OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

16.2. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DRIFT’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES YOU HAVE PAID TO DRIFT, OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO DRIFT FOR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR FIFTY DOLLARS (\$50) IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO DRIFT, AS APPLICABLE.

IN NO EVENT WILL DRIFT'S SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACTORS (INCLUDING THEIR MEMBERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES OR ADVISORS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNUITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SIMILAR DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING LOSSES OF FIAT, ASSETS, DATA, INFORMATION, REVENUE, OPPORTUNITIES, USE, GOODWILL, PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL BENEFIT) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE AND THE SERVICES.

16.4. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN DRIFT AND YOU.

17. LAW AND FORUM CHOICE

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the jurisdiction of the British Virgin Islands, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 18 below “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Drift are required to arbitrate will be in Singapore (the seat of arbitration) and the language of the arbitration shall be in English, to which you and Drift each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

18.1. You agree that if any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) cannot be resolved between the parties, it will be resolved solely by binding individual arbitration and not in a class action, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Drift each agree to waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in any class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.

18.2. As limited exceptions to this Section 18, Drift may seek to resolve a Dispute in a small claims court if it qualifies; and retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of Drift's intellectual property rights.

18.3. Parties must only submit a Dispute to arbitration where there has been attempts in good faith to resolve the Dispute and parties have not been able to reach an agreement.  The arbitration will be conducted at the seat of arbitration specified above. A party who wishes to undertake arbitration must provide advanced written notice to the other party. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the party filing for arbitration.

18.4. Any arbitration hearings will be conducted confidentially and remotely, to the extent permitted by the relevant seat of arbitration rules, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that there shall only be one arbritrator and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.

18.5. Except as provided in this Section, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or Drift prevails on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.

18.6. YOU AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution Section shall be null and void.

18.7. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 18.6 of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.

18.8. Both you and Drift agree that any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim arose, otherwise the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Drift will not have the right to assert the claim.
