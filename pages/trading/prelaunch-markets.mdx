# Prelaunch Market

Prelaunch Markets are custom markets that allow users to trade before Oracle availability.

Instead, they use a [custom oracle source](/trading/market-specs#prelaunch) that uses the current mark TWAP (with window = the funding period) and a custom max price.

To avoid and isolate risk between other markets, all Prelaunch Markets currently have an isolated contract tier which implies:
- no external insurance
- no cross-margin (no additional perpetual liabilities and spot liabilities beyond pnl settlement are permitted)
- conservative max open interest caps

**W-PERP Configuration:**
- Oracle source: [Prelaunch](/trading/market-specs#prelaunch)
- Contract tier: [Isolated](/trading/market-specs#isolated)
- Leverage: 3x (with a maintenance leverage of 6x)
- Maker/Taker fees: -4/20 bps
- Liquidation fee: 5% (on notional)
