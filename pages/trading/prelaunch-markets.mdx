# Prelaunch Market

Prelaunch Markets are custom markets that allow users to trade before Oracle availability. Instead, they use a custom oracle source that uses the current mark twap (with window = the funding period) and a custom max price.

To avoid and isolate risk between other markets, all Prelaunch Markets currently have:
- an isolated contract tier
- no external insurance
- conservative max open interest caps

**W-PERP Configuration:**
- Oracle source: Prelaunch
- Contract tier: Isolated
- Leverage: 3x (with a maintenance leverage of 6x)
- Maker/Taker Fees: -4/20 bps
- Liquidation Fee: 5% (on notional)
