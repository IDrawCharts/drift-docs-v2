# Prelaunch Market

Prelaunch Markets are custom markets that allow users to trade before Oracle availability. Instead, they use a custom oracle source that uses the current mark twap (with window = the funding period) and a custom max price.

To avoid and isolate risk between other markets, all Prelaunch Markets currently have:
- an isolated contract tier
- no external insurance
- conservative max open interest caps

W-PERP configuration:
- oracle source = prelaunch
- contract tier = isolated
- 3x leverage, 6x maint leverage
- -4/20 bps maker/taker fees
- 5% liquidation fee (on notional)
