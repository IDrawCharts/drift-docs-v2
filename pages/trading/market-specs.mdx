# Perpetual Markets Specs

## Contract Tier
Contract tiers are used to categorically label and rank the risk of perpetual markets. There are five unique tiers:
- A
- B
- C
- Speculative
- Isolated

These ranked tiers are used for priority access to collateral in liquidations, max limits for insurance, and determining acceptable range of oracle price di and sanitization rules for twap / funding rate updates.

Speculative tier have no access to external insurance funds (only the perpetual market's fee pool)

Isolated tier requires the user account refrain / disable cross margin trading (on both perpetual and spot markets). If the account has liabilities beyond the perpetual market's quote asset and the isolated perp market, it is forced to enter reduce only mode.
- Users with 'Margin Trading Enabled', a non-USDC (for pnl settlement) borrow, or another perpetual position will NOT be allowed to enter an Isolated 

## Oracle Source
The oracle provider which provides a price, confidence band, and timeliness information for the market.
- Pyth
- Switchboard
- Prelaunch


For Prelaunch markets, given there is no spot reference price, that oracle sources uses the mark twap as the oracle price. The oracle is also configured with a custom maximum price to prevent price manipulation. 

This self referential and leads to funding payments that encourage price stability (those holding positions in trend will pay those holding against trend) and ultimately relies upon market participants anticipating a valid oracle in the future.
