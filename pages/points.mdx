# Drift Points Program

There are two ways to earn Drift points:

1. [**Drift Trader Points**](https://www.drift.trade/updates/update-drift-trader-points) 
2. [**Market Maker Participation**](https://www.drift.trade/updates/introducing-drift-market-maker-rewards) 

## FAQs:

### Last week I made X volume, why did I get only X points?

Points may display as zero or lower than expected if:
- you didn't trade within the specified weekly window / before the snapshot was taken*,
- if you didn't engage in activities eligible for rewards (such as providing liquidity on the order book, DLP, perps + spot trading volume), or
- if your volume was significantly lower than that of other participating parties in this point system.

*Trading activity after the snapshot will be rewarded in the following week.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Volume is not the only variable in points distribution function. The points breakdown will be disclosed once the program wraps up to avoid gamification and ensure fairness.

### What activities are being rewarded?

Points are rewarded for:
- providing liquidity on the order book (maker orders or [market maker participation](https://www.drift.trade/updates/introducing-drift-market-maker-rewards)),
- DLP,
- perps + spot trading volume.

We recommend trading organically.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Engaging in activities like wash trading or self-referring is strictly prohibited, potentially leading to disqualification from earning points for a week or the entire program duration.

### What does 'Providing liquidity on the orderbook' means?

You have two options for providing liquidity:
1. Run a Just-in-Time (JIT) trading bot. Find a tutorial [here](/tutorial-bots/trading-bots/tutorial-jit-trading-bot), and don't hesitate to ask questions in the #⚡️ | jit-market-making channel on our Discord server.
2. Through the user interface (UI) by placing resting (post only) limit orders or oracle limit orders. For more details on different order types, check out our [All Order Types](/trading/all-order-types) guide.


### Does lending/borrowing/staking to Insurance fund/staking to super stake sol reward points?
These activities will be rewarded to our loyal users as OG points for their participation before the start of the points program (Jan 22nd). OG points will be distributed after the trader points program ends. We've taken the snapshot of the previous activity.

### How big is the points pool? 

There is 2 million points rewarded every week.
