## Wallet FAQ

### Do I need SOL in my wallet?  

Yes, all interactions with the platform will require a small amount of SOL for the gas fees on the blockchain.  


### I have paid some SOL while creating an account on Drift. What is this?

It is called **dynamic account rent**. Every account pays an account rent around 0.035 SOL to create an account on Drift. During sybil activity (when a lot of users are signing up) Drift's program adds an excess fee above this rent amount. For example, an user can pay 0.035+0.185 $SOL = 0.22 SOL to create an account.

This amount can be fully redeemed. For _excess amount_ (0.185 amount on above example), users need to wait 13 days to reclaim their excess $SOL rent. For the _rent_ (0.035 amount on above example), users need to delete their account which they created on Drift to redeem that amount back. 

**Deleting an account deletes all history attached to that Drift account, and there is no retrieval for this.**

**Steps for reclaiming dynamic account rent**: Click on your wallet adress displaced on top right of the screen. Click on Manage. You'll see thrash/bin icon with a red colour. 
Make sure:

-You don't have any open borrows on your account. You can check that on the [**Balances**](https://app.drift.trade/overview/balances) page. 

-Make sure you don't have any unsettled PnL. If you have it, make sure to settle.

-Get your account to zero balances (Withdraw your balances from Drift).

-Clicking the bin/thrash icon will delete your account history and redeem your account rent instantly, without requiring any additional steps.

**Steps for reclaiming excess fee**: Click on your wallet adress displaced on top right of the screen. Click on manage. 
Under "reclaimable rent" you'll see a "Claim" button. Clicking that button will return your account any excess fee (if you paid while creating an account on Drift) instantly.

### Does my wallet support versioned transactions?

Versioned transactions need to be turned on to use Drift's Swaps feature. Read more about versioned transactions and which wallets support it [**here**](/trading/versioned-transactions).
