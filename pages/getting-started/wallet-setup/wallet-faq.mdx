## Wallet FAQ

### Do I need SOL in my wallet?  

Yes, all interactions with the platform will require a small amount of SOL for the gas fees on the blockchain.  

### Does it cost money to create an account?  

Yes. The Solana blockchain requires a small amount of SOL to store the state of your positions on Drift. This costs 0.035 SOL. This is called **Rent**. This fee is only paid on the creation of a new account and each subaccount.  

***Note***: To trade on Drift, you'll eventually need more than 0.035 SOL to facilitate and approve transactions.

### Will I get my rent back?

Yes. If at any time you decide to close your account you will get the rent back for that associated account.  

### Does my wallet support versioned transactions?

Versioned transactions need to be turned on to use Drift's Swaps feature. Read more about versioned transactions and which wallets support it [**here**](pages/trading/versioned-transactions.mdx).
