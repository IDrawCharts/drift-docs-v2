# Drift Liquidity Provider (DLP) 

## Overview

Users that elect to use DLP and provide liquidity will be able to select which market they'd like to provide liquidity to. By doing so, the user becomes an LP.

Providing liquidity increases the total pool of liquidity available within that market by increasing ***K***. In turn, this lowers slippage and reduces price impact resulting in an overall better trading experience for other users.

Since the liquidity added to a perpetuals market is cross margined within Drift, you'll continue to earn lending interest and have capital available for margin trading.

For an in-depth overview of how DLP works, please see [**Liquidity Providers (LPs)**](/providing-liquidity/liquidity-providers).
