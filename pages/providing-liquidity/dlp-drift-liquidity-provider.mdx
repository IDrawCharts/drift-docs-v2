# Drift Liquidity Provider (DLP)

## Overview

Users that elect to use DLP and provide liquidity will be able to select which market they'd like to provide liquidity to. By doing so, the user becomes an LP.

Providing liquidity increases the total pool of liquidity available within that market's virtual AMM (vAMM) by increasing `sqrtK`. In turn, this reduces the price impact improving execution quality on the vAMM backstop for other users.

Since the liquidity added to a perpetuals market is cross margined within Drift, you'll continue to earn lending interest and have capital available for margin trading.

For an in-depth overview of how DLP works, please see [**DLP Technical Explainer**](/providing-liquidity/liquidity-providers).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
DLP involves leverage and opens perpetual positions on behalf of the user.

This requires the user to actively manage their account's inventory / risk for best results.

Before using DLP, even with low leverage, please read through all the documentation careful.

### Getting Started with DLP

You’ll take on a share of the vAMM’s positions as a counterparty to other Drift traders. For example, if a Drift trader goes short, you’ll receive a long position.

Your liquidity is represented as open orders (bids/asks) and you’ll see your DLP positions in the positions table:

### Position Updates & Management

vAMM

Adding lp shares, As new trades are filled, your perp position in that market can be updated.

Reducing lp shares reduces the flow of updates to that market's perp position.

The exact flow of position depends on the fill action vs the vAMM (this can be a proto-rata split of protocol-owned and user-owned liquidity or just one or the other).

The AMM can fill as a backstop and participate along side other user maker orders to partially rebalance inventory.

You can manage your risk manually by reducing the perp position or closing it via the close button in the positions table.

### Setting max leverage for your subaccount

A subaccount max leverage is suggested when you add liquidity but can be adjusted in the settings. This setting adjusts your margin requirement for increasing DLP positions. If your account falls below the collateral requirement shown on DLP page, the next P&L settle will trigger de-risking of the position. You can also opt out of this in Margin/Leverage Settings.
